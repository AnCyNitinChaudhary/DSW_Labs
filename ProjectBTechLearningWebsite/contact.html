		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<h3>
		<div class="text">
		The problem that our project will solve is the learning issue faced by the students of B.Tech CSE and cannot learn all the complex topics due to which they lose marks in their exams. Our project will help all such students and make learning B.Tech subjects easier for them by providing them with many hacks, tips, visualizations, top content links etc.
The project will be helpful not only for the students who are trying to learn the topic by themselves but also for the teacher so that we can facilitate them and make it easier for the teacher so that they have to spend less time on a given difficult topic to teach. They can very easily use this project of ours and explain the different difficult topics that we have included to explain it to their respective students
